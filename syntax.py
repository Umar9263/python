# Execute Python Syntax

# Python Indentation:--
    # Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
    # Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
    # Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    # Example:-

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")

# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
# Example:-
# if 5 > 2:
# print("Five is greater than two!")

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
# Example:-
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 

# Python Variables

# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

# Comments
# Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
# Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

# This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
